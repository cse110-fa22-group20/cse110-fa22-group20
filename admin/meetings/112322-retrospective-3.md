## Agenda
### What went well last week?
    - Video creation went well
    - Finished CRUD functionality way ahead of schedule (week 8) :D
### What can be improved from last week?
    - Emphasize due date (Sunday) more
    - PR review times
      - Ping/assign specific people who might have some sort of connection to a PR for reviews
    - Error on main with multiple text posts
      - Need more robust testing
    - Practicality over style
      - In place text editing might have sounded good on paper but in practice it wasn't very effective. Should have gone with the popup solution right off the bat
