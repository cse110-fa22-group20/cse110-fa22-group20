## Agenda
### What went well last week?
    - Process was good in its entirety 
      - Navid's guidelines of having everything done in 3.5 weeks was accurate
      - Larger margin of error by finishing earlier
    - Team did great work 
### What can be improved from last week?
    - Class didn't guide learning enough
      - There should be discussions going over what we learned
      - Professor should focus on material instead of speaking about industry
    - There should be more time for the project, starting at week 5/6 does not feel good
