## Agenda
### Previous Business
- Settled on a "fake social media" concept
- Creates posts and maintain a scrapbook/photo album/personal page without needing to be online
- CRUD
  - C: create posts
  - R: read/view posts on your personal page
  - U: update posts (images and caption)
  - D: delete posts
### New Business
- Competition
  - Instagram
    - Commercialized
    - No longer about friends, more business-like
  - BeReal
    - Meant to be for friends
    - Still has that social element that could be kind of toxic
- Problems we solve for
  - Privacy
  - Social media burnout
  - Creating a local expression board
  - Exclusivity 
  - The lack of personalization on default photo storage apps like gallery
- Features
  - Both text and image posts
    - Image
      - Picture
      - Caption
      - Tags (if time permits)
    - Text
  - Future ability to post your page to a link and share that link with other people
    - This way only those you truly care about can see your pictures
    - Might be a nice solution for your relatives 
- Users
  - Old people who post inappropriate things to social medias can have this sort of fake board where they think they're communicating with others but they're really not
  - People who are super privacy centric and want a cool way to store their photos without having to depend on the good will of social media companies not to steal their information
  - People who are tired of the endless social media rat race and just want to store their pictures somewhere
- Decision
	- Name is going to be "Unplugged"
    	- Reason: it's like when you unplug your little brother's controller when he's playing video games with you so he feels like he's still playing
    	- Dissent: none
### Unresolved Business
- N/A
